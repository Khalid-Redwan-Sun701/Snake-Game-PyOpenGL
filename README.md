# The iconic Snake Game created using only the OpenGL Library.
## This game was a part of the BracU CSE423 lab projects for Spring2023.
The requirements were that we could not use any other library such as PyGame to complete this project.
It had to be done entirely using PyOpenGL and the included OpenGL libraries.
