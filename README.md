# The iconic Snake Game created using only the OpenGL Library.
## This game was a part of the BracU CSE423 lab projects for Spring2023.
The requirements were that we could not use any other library such as PyGame to complete this project.
It had to be done entirely using PyOpenGL and the included OpenGL libraries.

### Instructions to Run the game:
1. Create a python Project in virtual environment (venv) (use PyCharm for less hassle) <br>

2. Install necessary libraries inside of the virtual environment <br>
     i. Open terminal inside the virtual environment <br>
    ii. Check Python version using command:
   ```bash
   py -V
   ```
   iii. Go to the following link: Python Extension Packages for Windows - Christoph Gohlke (uci.edu) https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#_pyopengl:~:text=PyOpenGL%E2%80%913.1.5%E2%80%91cp36%E2%80%91cp36m%E2%80%91win_amd64.wh and download the files with names as below: <br>
   ```bash
   PyOpenGL‑3.1.6‑cp3x‑cp3x‑win_amd64.whl
   ```
   ```bash
   PyOpenGL_accelerate‑3.1.6‑cp3x‑cp3x‑win_amd64.whl
   ```
   Replace cp3x with your version of python <br>
   For example, if your version of python is 3.10 then your code should be like: <br>
   ```bash
   PyOpenGL‑3.1.6‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
   ```
   ```bash
   PyOpenGL_accelerate‑3.1.6‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
   ```
   Note that here <b>cp3x is replaced by cp310</b>, that is, <b>instead of x you have to write <i>your version</i> of python</b>.
4. Download the snake.py script in the same folder. <br>

5. Now you can run the game!
